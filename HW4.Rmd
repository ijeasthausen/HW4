#Problem 1
For this problem, we will use the `pups` dataset. Below, we read and clean the data, coverting from 'wide' to 'long' formmat. 
```{r}
#load and clean data
pups = readr::read_csv(file = "FAS_pups.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  gather(key = pd_outcome, value = days, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>%
  mutate(pd_outcome = str_replace(pd_outcome, 'pd_', ""), 
         litter_number = str_replace(litter_number, '#', ''))
```
